#Bookmark Question
Are the sites where you spend most of your time actually adding value to your life?

Lets say you spend much of your time browsing /r/reallifedoodles and you have a bookmark to this page. You can replace your old bookmark with a BookmarkQuestion link to that same page. BookmarkQuestion will then periodically help you question if the site is adding value to your life.

#Technical notes
This was an experiment in creating a maintainable single page ES5 app without using any JS libraries or frameworks. The app is lightweight and fully functional in all evergreen browsers. Separation of concerns was not fully achieved though. Also, not using a template language is rough. I recommend sticking with JS frameworks.
