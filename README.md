#Are the websites where you spend most of your time actually adding value to your life?
Lets say you spend much of your time browsing /r/reallifedoodles and you have a
bookmark to this page.
You can replace this bookmark with a HowManyTimes redirect URL to that same page to be reminded
to question its value before visiting.

#Future TODO
XSS filter domain names
Allow custom question (be sure to XSS filter)
Allow randomness where the question shows 1 out of x times
