#Are the websites where you spend most of your time actually adding value to your life?
Lets say you spend much of your time browsing /r/reallifedoodles and you have a
bookmark to this page.
You can replace this bookmark with a BookmarkQuestion redirect URL to that same page to be reminded
to question its value before visiting.

#Technical notes
- This was an experiment in creating a maintainable single page ES5 app without using any JS libraries or frameworks. Separation of concerns was not fully achieved. Not using a template language is rough. I recommend sticking with JS frameworks.
